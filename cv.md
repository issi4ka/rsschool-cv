## ABOUT ME
#### *Positive traits of my character are perseverance, accuracy and responsibility. I try to maintain order and tidiness around me and always finish what I started. At work, my strengths help me cope even with the most painstaking and boring tasks. I also learned how to use my weakness, low stress resistance, to improve my results. To avoid stress, I always plan my work in such a way as to deliver completed projects ahead of the deadline. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, reading, playing sports, and spending time with my family. My friends may say that I am interesting, charming, energetic but sometimes annoying. I will always find something to do for everyone, but everyone just needs a bit of peace and quiet sometimes. I plan not to stop learning something new and constantly improve my professional skills.*
